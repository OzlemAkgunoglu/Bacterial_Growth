# Bacterial_Growth
This is homework for an online synthetic biology course.
Its about liquid culture of bacteria that divide every 30 minutes.We model this system as an ODE.
Infinite culture model :  make the approximation that the number of bacteria is continuous and bacteria appear with a half-life of 30 minutes.Then with this ODE writing to plot the concentration of cells in the culture over time at 5 minute intervals from 0 min to 120 min, starting with one cell, 2 cells, and 10 cells per unit volume in the initial culture.
Finite culture model(Lotka model): With doubling time 30 minutes k=log(2)/30;set carrying capacity K is 300 cells per unit volume;set four  model ode starting with 1,10,300 and 400 cells per unit volume, and then plotting this model .
