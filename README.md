# Bacterial_Growth
This is homework for an online synthetic biology course.
Its about liquid culture of bacteria that divide every 30 minutes.We model this system as an ODE, hence make the approximation that the number of bacteria is continuous and bacteria appear with a half-life of 30 minutes.Then with this ODE writing to plot the concentration of cells in the culture over time at 5 minute intervals from 0 min to 120 min, starting with one cell, 2 cells, and 10 cells per unit volume in the initial culture.
